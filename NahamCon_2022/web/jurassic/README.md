# Jurassic Park
Dr. John Hammond has put together a small portfolio about himself for his new theme park, Jurassic Park. Check it out here! 

# Solution
Start instance. Navigate to site. Single page website. No visible links. Check source? There's an assets/img/portfolio/ directory and a css directory.

Going to assets we get a directory tree. The expected img directory is there. traversing to img/portfolio there are the images we expect as well as a "backup.jpg" 

Not a stego problem, so as expected, noting in the image. 

Checking out /robots.txt tells us there is a directory /ingen/
Going there shows flag.txt
