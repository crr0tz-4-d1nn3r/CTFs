It Killed the Dinos!

My friend sent me this message, and I know there's something hidden inside. Can you help?

"Hidden below the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the Chicxulub crater marks the impact site of an asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago. The most consequential outcome of this cataclysmic event was the fifth mass extinction, which wiped out about 80% of all animal species, including the nonavian dinosaurs."
