# NahamCon 2022
So many challenges, so little time. This one started on Thursday. Didn't really get working on it until Friday night after work. Team of one, worked on it for a few hours.

Have to say, there seems to be some great problems. Grabed some for later fun.

Finally score was 954 and came in 684th place :). Spent Friday night working on the easy problems. Really should start on some medium to hard problems. Easy ones are fun, usually quick, but they don't teach as much as reinforce existing skills. I like points, but I should work on learning - not winning.
