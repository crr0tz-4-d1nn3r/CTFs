# Grayhat CTF 2020
This CTF was part of the virtual conference. Deveoped by Pwneip. Consisted of previous challenges as well as a few "new to me" ones. I concentrated mostly on the Tunneler series and found them fun and educational. I had never used SSH to tunnel and had not used Proxychains (which has become one of my go-to tools now, thanks!)

## Impressions
I enjoy Pwneip's challenges - they have a pretty clear workflow and the flavor text is helpful. With many participants hitting the same machines it can get crowded and machines have to be reset often. Also, not everyone cleans up after themselves. I found a few "answers" on the boxes I visted. Some of those were not the approach that I think the creater had in mind - not bad, just not quite the point of the challenge.
