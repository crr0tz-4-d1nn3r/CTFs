A german messenger was caught during WW2

He was carrying a piece of paper that read: qbhbh zrmua gfbld ocqbv

He was nice enough to give us all we wanted, except the decoded message, he needs a special machine for that, and we don't have it.

He DID give us the settings for the machine.

The settings for this machine are:

Model: G-312

Reflector: UKW 11/26

Rotor 1: 2/12/6

Rotor 2: 1/17/16

Rotor 3: 3/12/1

The flag is ONE word, no spaces. do NOT translate the flag!#

## Flag:
```
sauerkraut
```

## Solution
"German" "WW2", "G-312","Rotors". This is an Enigma cipher. One of the better tools for the use of the inforamtion is [https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-decoder](https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-decoder).

 The message is 
```

```
