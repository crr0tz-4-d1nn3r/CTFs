A french messenger was caught during the war

He was carrying a piece of paper that read: Vvr ktdk vl jvtzsyHBI{fnzcievs}

Upon torturing the messenger for an explaination, he only shouted 'confidentiel'!!!

Too bad he died, I bet something good was in that message :(

## Solution
"French" and the characters in the cipher text made me think of Vigenere. Cyber Chef. Need a key. Maybe 'confidentiel'? Yes.
