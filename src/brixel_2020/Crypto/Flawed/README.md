Our l33t hackers hacked a bulletin board and gained access to the database. We need to find the admin password.

The user's database info is:

Username:admin

Passwordhash:d269ce15f9c44bc3992a5f4e5f273e06

The flag is the plaintext password

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format

## Flag:
```
notsecure
```
