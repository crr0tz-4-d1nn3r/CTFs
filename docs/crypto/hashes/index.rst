Hashes
================

A hash function takes an arbitrary message of arbitrary length and creates an output (a hash) of a fixed length. They are considered one-way functions (it is easy to compute the hash; given the hash, it is difficult to compute the message). The usually attack is to use a rainbow table or to try and find a collision.
