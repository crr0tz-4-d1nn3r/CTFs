#  A song...

I wrote this song

it seems I'm pretty bad at it, but hey! it could get you a flag :)


## Flag
```

## Solution

Wasn't sure what to make of this at first. But I recently watched a talk on the creation of an esoteric programming language "Rockstar". It's a pretty good talk if you haven't seen it, covers a bunch of other programming topics.

Parsing this program was a bit tedious, but doable. Read the docs:

There is also a way to just run the code on that same site.
