We are investigating an individual we believe is connected to a group smuggling drugs into the country and selling them on social media. You have been posted on a stake out in the apartment above theirs and with the help of space-age eavesdropping technology have managed to extract some data from their computer. What is the phone number of the suspect's criminal contact?

flag format includes country code so it should be in the format: rgbCTF{+00000000000}
